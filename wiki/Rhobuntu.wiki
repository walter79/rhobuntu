* [Ubuntu on Rhodium |http://forum.xda-developers.com/showthread.php?t=640785]

----

Right now Ubuntu only runs from [HaRET |http://wiki.xda-developers.com/index.php?pagename=HaRET] on a sd card.  No it is not available to flash to the internal memory yet.  It is still very much in the development stages.

Installation

In order to run Ubuntu, start by [formating your sd card to Fat32 |http://thewingster.com/howformatfat32.aspx] (it may be necessary to perform a full format rather than "quick format").



Simpy download the new build here: http://forum.xda-developers.com/showthread.php?t=640785 and copy all files to your sd card.


Mirror: http://www.connect-utb.com/index.php?option=com_rokdownloads&view=file&Itemid=68&id=103:ubuntu-for-rhodium


Next: run /Ubuntu/Haret.exe


ONLY FOR EXPERIENCED USERS

-for those real linux freaks out there: Ubuntu can be booted from an ext2/ext3 partition on your sd-card. No images! All changes are persistent! All you need is just an sd-card with two partitions (1st FAT32, 2nd ext2/3) and a special initrd.gz.
Grab it here: http://www.megaupload.com/?d=S1YH6GA0
Simpy mount Ubuntu.img via
sudo mount Ubuntu.img /mnt -o loop
run sudo nautilus and copy all files and folders from /mnt to the ext2/3 partition on the sd card (ignore errors). Then copy the Ubuntu folder containing haret.ext, start.txt,intrd.gz and zimage to the FAT32 partition. Replace initrd.gz with the special initrd.gz. Run haret.exe.
